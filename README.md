Users will begin on the onboarding page, where they are introduced to the app’s purpose. From there, they’ll interact with a simple interface to select their financial concerns. Based on their choices, the app will display personalized guidance on the advice page. If users wish to connect further, they can enter their name and email on the lead capture form. After submission, they’ll land on a confirmation page. To power this functionality, the app will integrate Formspree for handling form submissions and may utilize Google Fonts for consistent branding. Core technologies will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with optional use of Calendly APIs for future enhancements.
